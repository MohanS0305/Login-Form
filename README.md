In this project, you will create a visually appealing and user-friendly login form using HTML and CSS. The login form will consist of input fields for the user to enter their username/email and password. Additionally, there will be a "Login" button that users can click to submit their credentials.

HTML Structure:

Create a <form> element to wrap the login inputs and button.
Inside the form, create <input> elements for the username/email and password fields.
Include a <button> element for the "Login" action.

CSS Styling:

Apply a modern and clean design using CSS styling.
Use CSS selectors to target form elements and apply styles like padding, margins, and borders.
Implement a color scheme that complements the overall design.
Utilize CSS properties like border-radius for rounded corners and box-shadow for depth effects.
Implement responsive design to ensure the form looks good on various screen sizes.

Layout and Alignment:

Use CSS flexbox or grid layout to create a well-organized structure.
Align the form elements neatly and symmetrically.
Implement appropriate spacing between input fields and the "Login" button.

Validation and Interaction:

Incorporate CSS transitions to add smooth animations on hover and focus states for input fields and the "Login" button.
Implement visual cues for input validation, such as changing border color on invalid input or displaying error messages.

Background and Visual Elements:

Consider adding a background image or a solid color backdrop to enhance the visual appeal. In this case i am using one background image for this website. I put that image in image folder.

Responsive Design:

Ensure the login form adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets.
Use media queries to adjust styles and layout for various breakpoints.
